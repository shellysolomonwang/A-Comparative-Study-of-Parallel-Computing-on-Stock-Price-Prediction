# A-Comparative-Study-of-Parallel-Computing-on-Stock-Price-Prediction
The project uses a stock price prediction dataset to run on various designed AWS clusters and local machines. The purpose of this study is to testify the scalability and time-efficiency on parallized cloud servers and local servers among different stock price prediction models. This project aims to give insights to the stock market movement and five different algorithmsâ€™ implementations through Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) with two nodes, four nodes and six nodes, and local computers.
